DNSCurve forwarder

This directory contains a prototype DNSCurve forwarder.  Currently it
only supports UDP transport, and it also relies on Linux's epoll(2)
system call.

Faried Nawaz has written instructions on how to install and setup the
forwarder at http://marc.info/?l=djbdns&m=124905592501607&w=2.
